# Physics-231-Final-project-
This is the final project for physics 231. I was the primary author and some adaptations were done by Max Trostel.
Here we simmulated a trebuchet. We analyzed how different parameters affected the optimization of the trebuchet. 
There are images showing the trebuchet and some countour plots comparing for instance the mass of the projectile and the mass of the counterweight.
